## Universal K-Sortable Globally Unique ID
---

A KSUID package that implements/will-implement required Marshalling/Unmarshalling interfaces for various types.

**Based on [github.com/segmentio/ksuid][0]**.

### Why?

*From [https://github.com/TerrexTech/uuuid][1], but story remains the same.*

It has been a source of great pain and inconvenience for my lazy existence, that the UUIDs have to be
converted again and again to different types for operations such as inserting/fetching from Databases.

Enough. Not any more.
